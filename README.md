# Open Bioinformatics Course #3

## This is an IPython notebook from the 3rd week of an online course on Bioinformatics.

In this week the task was to find a motif, a motif in DNA is a gene which is repeated multiple times throughout
the genome. The genome is separated into a set of equal length strings and a k-mer(DNA string of length k) is
selected from each, and then this is collected together as a motif matrix.
